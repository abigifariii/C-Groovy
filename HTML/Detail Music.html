            Chasing a heart is like chasing a ghost You can't make somebody you love feel the same If they don't It doesn't matter the words that you say 'Cause just like the seasons, you can't stop the way People change I'd drive through
            the night Walk a thousand miles To feel your head on my chest I'd give anything That's what's killing me 'Cause you won't even reach across the bed The silence is getting too cold We stopped fighting 'Cause deep down inside, we
            both know Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth Do you only love me 'cause you have to? All of your friends now were all of mine first Your mom and your dad they were both there for me When mine weren't I
            can't see tomorrow without you today But I'd rather let you go Than make you feel like you've gotta stay I'd drive through the night Walk a thousand miles To feel your head on my chest I'd give anything That's what's killing me
            'Cause you won't even reach across the bed The silence is getting too cold We stopped fighting 'Cause deep down inside, we both know Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth Do you only love me 'cause you have
            to? So come on, don't be afraid to break my heart It only gets worse if you wait Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth Do you only love me 'cause you have to? I'm so sorry, I wish I could be The one to love
            you more I hope you find somebody Who's got everything you're searching for The silence is getting too cold We stopped fighting 'Cause deep down inside, we both know Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth Do
            you only love me 'cause you have to?
